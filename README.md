Password manager created using django that can save passwords to a secure database(supabase) and then retrieve and search according to websites of the credentials.
A chrome extension has been created which can generate strong passwords on the go and also show strong passwords right next to the password field in a sign up form which the user can click to paste it onto the password field.
User can search for credentials in the extension as well.
